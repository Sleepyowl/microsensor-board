PROBLEMS with revisions

v0.1
- no resistor between bulk cap and battery (still works though)
- RV2038 EVT pin is floating (higher current consumption)

v0.2
- i2c routed to invalid pins
	- nRF54 needs both on port1 and "clock-capable" pin for SCL
	- possible will work with both on port0 with &i2c30
	- "fixable" by sacrificing button and test point (used for UART TX)
- N-MOS is not needed on this board
	- fixable by bridging two pads of Q2
- Divider saturates nRF54 ADC with internal vref 
	- fixable with 100K resistor instead of 220K resistor
